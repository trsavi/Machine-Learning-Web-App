3. Data collection and preparation

	* ETL (Extract, transform and load)
			- Extraction (python)
			- Transform (python)
			- Load (SQL & python)
	* EDA (Explanatory Data Analysis)/Descriptive analysis

4. Build a model
	- build model for prediciton
	- build model for recomendation
	- evaluate models
	- save models

5. Combine models and webpage
	- combine functions such as train/test/predict
	- create sort of dashboard for prediction (https://www.chartjs.org/)
