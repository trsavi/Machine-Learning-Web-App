This project represents full-stack Data Science project, from collecting raw data from website to deploying actual application to streamlit framework. It incorporates ETL, EDA, ML and model deployment as key features of this project. Also, all of this could be orchestrated through machine learning pipeline into one single project file. 

## ETL - Extract Transform Load

One of the first things that we need to accomplish is to extract raw data from a data source, in this case I [webscraped] (https://github.com/trsavi/Machine-Learning-Web-App/blob/main/PolovniAutomobili%20WebScraper.ipynb) a website.
